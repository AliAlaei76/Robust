# Robust
In this project, I simulated the global consensus region of Lipschitz Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems using MATLAB. Then, I derived a consensus protocol by solving LMIs (Linear Matrix Inequalities) in the LMI
toolbox of MATLAB. Afterward, I applied the calculated consensus protocol to a network of 6 single-link manipulators and simulated their behavior for verification. The codes and results of the simulations are available in this repository.
