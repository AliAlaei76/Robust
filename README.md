# Robust
In this project, I simulated global consensus region of Lipschitz Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems using MATLAB. Then, I derived consensus protocol by solving LMIs (Linear Matrix Inequalities) in the LMI
toolbox of MATLAB. Afterward, I applied the calculated consensus protocol to a network of 6 singlelink manipulators and simulating their behavior for verification.
